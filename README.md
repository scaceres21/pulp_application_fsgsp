# PuLP application to the FSGSP

This repo shows the optimisation of the flowshop group scheduling problem (FSGSP) using the PuLP module and IBM's ILOG CPLEX 12.0 solver in Python 3.8.

The repo contains the following files:

* [A mathematical formulation for the FSGSP](https://github.com/scaceres21/pulp_application_fsgsp/blob/main/Mixed-Integer%20Programming%20Model%20for%20the%20FSGSP.ipynb): The Mixed-Integer Programming Model 1 presented by Naderi and Salmasi (2012). This model was proposed to minimise the Total Completion Times of Jobs.
